# etch-a-sketch

This project is an implementation of a 16x16 Etch-a-Sketch. The outline for the project can be found [here.](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project)

# Part 1: Understanding the Project

The finished product will be a 16x16 grid of white squares. When the user hovers their mouse over a box, the box will change to a random color value. 

A button will be on the site that will allow the user to clear the current grid and send the user a popup message asking for the side length of the new grid to be created.

The grid will allow a maximum width of 100.
